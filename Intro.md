In the west, we tend to view democracy as moral progress and the right way to do government. Or at the very least, we view democracy as the least bad option. This implies that we think of dictatorships as the worst. We get more democracy as we become morally better people, and we elect and expect better moral behavior from our officials. Or so at least is the idea we seem to hold in our heads.

Similary, myself (and any economist not funded by politicians) think that free-market libertarianism is the right way to stucture our economy. Or at the very least, the least bad option. The evidence is clear that countries grow much quicker when markets are free. All we have left to do is convince everybody else so we all vote for it.

Most of you will have been suspicious of either cookie-cutter solution. Unless you were suspicious of both, I suspect you have a blindspot. Let me explain.

If you're a parent of young kids, you quickly realize that democracy is not the best form of government in your household. On the contrary, it's down right irresponsible. Your kids will vote every single time to miss school and have ice-cream for lunch and dinner. If you have 3 kids, household democracy means you'll quickly end up in jail for child neglect - and your kids pre-diabetic. The right kind of governance structure in household with young kids is oligopoly, or dictatorship if you're a single parent. 

In such household, free market economics are also a bad idea - and likely illegal. Your kids should not have to negotiate or trade with you for food or shelter. In your home, central planning should be the rule. Mom and dad should figure out what you get, and you should (mostly) share with your siblings. Mom and dad should also decide that no, you don't get to use your allowance to buy a knife or a bb gun. And mom and dad should decide if they take your phone away or not.
